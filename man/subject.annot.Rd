\title{Load an annotation for a subject.}
\usage{
subject.annot(subjects_dir, subject_id, hemi, atlas)
}
\arguments{
\item{subjects_dir}{string. The FreeSurfer SUBJECTS_DIR, i.e., a directory containing the data for all your subjects, each in a subdir named after the subject identifier.}

\item{subject_id}{string. The subject identifier}

\item{hemi}{string, one of 'lh' or 'rh'. The hemisphere name. Used to construct the names of the annotation and morphometry data files to be loaded.}

\item{atlas}{string. The atlas name. E.g., "aparc", "aparc.2009s", or "aparc.DKTatlas". Used to construct the name of the annotation file to be loaded.}
}
\value{
the annotation, as returned by \code{\link[freesurferformats]{read.fs.annot}}. It is a named list, enties are: "vertices" vector of n vertex indices, starting with 0. "label_codes": vector of n integers, each entry is a color code, i.e., a value from the 5th column in the table structure included in the "colortable" entry (see below). "label_names": the n brain structure names for the vertices, already retrieved from the colortable using the code. "hex_colors_rgb": Vector of hex color for each vertex.
     The "colortable" is another named list with 3 entries: "num_entries": int, number of brain structures. "struct_names": vector of strings, the brain structure names. "table": numeric matrix with num_entries rows and 5 colums. The 5 columns are: 1 = color red channel, 2=color blue channel, 3=color green channel, 4=color alpha channel, 5=unique color code. "colortable_df": The same information as a dataframe. Contains the extra columns "hex_color_string_rgb" and "hex_color_string_rgba" that hold the color as an RGB(A) hex string, like "#rrggbbaa".
